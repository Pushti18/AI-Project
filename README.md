# AI-Project
This program is designed to recommend similar codes based on user input. The program uses Natural Language Processing techniques to preprocess and vectorize the codes, and then calculates the cosine similarity between the user input and each of the codes. The program outputs the codes that have the highest similarity to the user input.
